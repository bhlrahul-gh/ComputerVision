Description: Developed a virtual mouse control system using Python
and its libraries such as OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI. The
system tracks the movement of the index finger through a webcam feed

and enables users to control the mouse cursor on the screen in real-
time. Additionally, it utilizes facial landmarks for eye-blink detection,

enabling users to perform mouse clicks through a blink of an eye.
